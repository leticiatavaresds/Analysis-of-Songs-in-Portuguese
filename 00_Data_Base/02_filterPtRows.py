Description:
    This script connects to the SQLite database and performs data cleanup on the Genius table. Specifically, it:
    1. Connects to the SQLite database.
    2. Deletes rows from the Genius table where the 'language' column is not equal to 'pt'.
    3. Logs the number of rows deleted and the number of rows remaining in the table.
    4. Commits the changes to the database.
    5. Closes the database connection.
    
Usage:
    1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and accessible.
    2. Ensure that the database exists (created by script 01).
    3. Run the script: python 02_filterPtRows.py
